The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
In three words, I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment
